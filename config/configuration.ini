[errors]
;;; Errors.  Note that if scripts fail to parse no errors
;;; will show unless appropriate options are set in the system-wide
;;; php.ini file.
;;; If no output or errors are shown test all PHP scripts with
;;; php -l script.php / script.ini

;; Error reporting.
; E_ALL: Show all errors.  Use for debugging only.
; E_ERROR: Show fatal errors.
; E_STRICT: Show 'advice' from PHP re: compatibility

; To be honest, just leave it at E_ALL and make sure
; the errors don't go anywhere unsafe during production.
; That'll save you wondering why a failed 'require' statement
; produces no output under E_ERROR or E_STRICT
error_reporting = E_ALL

;; Where errors go.  Uncomment suitably.
; Display all errors in browsers.  Unwise in production.

[smarty]
;;; Smarty template engine.  Either version 2 or 3 should work.
;;
;; Leave this option commented if you have a package installed Smarty, it
;; should work if the Smarty directory is in the PHP include_path.
;; Otherwise set this option to the path to your locally installed Smarty.

;; smarty_location = "/usr/local/share/php/Smarty/Smarty.class.php"

[admin]

;;; messages will come to when users provide bogus email
;;; addresses.  It is _not_ where the email will _appear_ to
;;; be from (that will be the admin_email option above).
;;; Your MTA (sendmail or an SMTP connection) will probably
;;; not accept envelope_from addresses that are not literally
;;; user@host, where user is the user running the check_embargo
;;; script and host is where it is running, unless user is
;;; in a list of trusted hosts.
;;; If you can set things up so you can set the envelope_from
;;; then put what you want it to be in this option.  Otherwise
;;; it will default to whatever the MTA decides is right
;;; (which will probably be wrong).
;;; PS.  You may be tempted to use the 'no bounces' address of <>
;;; which may be permitted by your MTA.  However this often is detected
;;; at the receiving side as a good marker of spam.
